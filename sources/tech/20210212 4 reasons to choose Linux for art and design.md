选择Linux来做艺术设计的4个理由
======

开源会强化你的创造力。因为它把你带出私有化的思维定势，开阔你的视野，从而带来更多的可能性。探索一些开源的创意项目。

2021年，人们比以前的任何时候都更有理由来爱上Linux。在这个系列，我会分享21个选择Linux的原因。今天，让我来解释一下，为什么Linux是艺术设计的绝佳选择。

Linux在服务器和云计算方面获得很多的赞誉。让不少人感到惊讶的是，Linux刚好有一系列的创意设计工具，并且这些工具在用户体验和质量方面可以轻松打败那些流行的创意设计工具。我第一次使用开源的设计工具，并不是因为我没有其他工具可以选择。相反的，我是在接触了大量的这些领先的公司提供的私有化的设计工具后，才开始使用开源设计工具。我之所以最后选择开源设计工具是因为它们更合情而且我能获得更好的产出。以下是好几个方面，让我来慢慢解释吧！

### 高可用性意味着高生产力

“生产力”这一次对于不同的人来说含义不一样。当我想到生产力，就是当你坐下来做事情，并能够完成你给自己设定的所有任务的时候，这时就很有成就感。
但是当你总是被一些你无法掌控的事情打断，那你的生产力就下降了。

电脑有时候会显得无法预测，并且大家也公认在很多方面会有可能出问题。电脑是由很多的硬件组成的，它们任何一个都有可能在任何时间出问题。软件会有bug，以及修复这些bug的更新，而更新后又会带来新的bug。如果你对电脑不了解，它可能就像一个定时炸弹，等着爆发。带着数字世界里的这么多的潜在问题，去接受一个当某些条件不满足（比如授权，或者订阅费）就会不工作的软件，对我来说就显得很不理智。

开源的创意设计app不需要订阅费，也不需要授权。在你需要的时候，它们都能获取得到，并且通常都是跨平台的。这就意味着，当你坐在工作的电脑面前，你就能确定你能用到那些必需的软件。而如果某天你很忙碌，却发现你面前的电脑不工作了，解决办法就是找到一个能工作的，安装你的创意设计软件，然后开始工作。

想要找到一台无法运行Inkscape的电脑是很困难的。比找一台可以运行那些私有软件的电脑，还要难。这就叫做高可用。这是游戏规则的改变者。我从来不曾遇到因为软件用不了而不得不干等，浪费我数小时时间的事情。

### 开源更有多样性

我在设计行业工作的时候，我的很多同事都是通过自学的方式来学习艺术和技术方面的知识，这让我感到惊讶。有的通过使用那些最新的昂贵的“专业”软件来自学，当大部分人则是通过使用免费和开源的软件来完善他们的数字化的职业技能。因为，对于孩子，或者没钱的大学生来说，这才是他们能负担的起，而且很容易就能获得的。

高可用有很多种，但有一种对我而言很重要，而且对那些没有在设计行业但使用开源软件的人也很重要。即使那些有提供付费订阅的开源项目，比如Ardour，都能确保他的用户在不需要支付任何费用的时候也能使用软件。

Ardour

When you don't restrict who gets to use your software, you're implicitly inviting more users. And when you do that, you enable a greater diversity of creative voices. Art loves influence, and the greater the variety of experiences and ideas you have to draw from, the better. That's what's possible with open source creative software.

### Resolute format support is more inclusive

We all acknowledge the value of inclusivity in basically every industry. Inviting _more people_ to the party results in a greater spectacle, in nearly every sense. Knowing this, it's painful when I see a project or initiative that invites people to collaborate, only to limit what kind of file formats are acceptable. It feels archaic, like a vestige of elitism out of the far past, and yet it's a real problem even today.

In a surprise and unfortunate twist, it's not because of technical limitations. Proprietary software has access to open file formats because they're open source and free to integrate into any application. Integrating these formats requires no reciprocation. By stark contrast, proprietary file formats are often shrouded in secrecy, locked away for use by the select few who pay to play. It's so bad, in fact, that quite often, you can't open some files to get to your data without the proprietary software available. Amazingly, open source creative applications nevertheless include support for as many proprietary formats as they possibly can. Here's just a sample of Inkscape's staggering support list:

And that's largely without contribution from the companies owning the file formats.

Supporting open file formats is more inclusive, and it's better for everyone.

### No restrictions for fresh ideas

One of the things I've come to love about open source is the sheer diversity of how any given task is interpreted. When you're around proprietary software, you tend to start to see the world based on what's available to you. For instance, if you're thinking of manipulating some photos, then you generally frame your intent based on what you know to be possible. You choose from the three of four or ten applications on the shelf because they're the only options presented.

You generally have several obligatory "obvious" solutions in open source, but you also get an additional _dozen_ contenders hanging out on the fringe. These options are sometimes only half-complete, or they're hyper-focused on a specific task, or they're challenging to learn, but most importantly, they're unique and innovative. Sometimes they've been developed by someone who's never seen the way a task is "supposed to be done," and so the approach is wildly different than anything else on the market. Other times, they're developed by someone familiar with the "right way" of doing something but is trying a different tactic anyway. It's a big, dynamic brainstorm of possibility.

These kinds of everyday innovations can lead to flashes of inspiration, moments of brilliance, or widespread common improvements. For instance, the famous GIMP filter that removes items from photographs and automatically replaces the background was so popular that it later got "borrowed" by proprietary photo editing software. That's one metric of success, but it's the personal impact that matters most for an artist. I marvel at the creativity of new Linux users when I've shown them just one simple audio or video filter or paint application at a tech demo. Without any instruction or context, the ideas that spring out of a simple interaction with a new tool can be exciting and inspiring, and a whole new series of artwork can easily emerge from experimentation with just a few simple tools.

There are also ways of working more efficiently, provided the right set of tools are available. While proprietary software usually isn't opposed to the idea of smarter work habits, there's rarely a direct benefit from concentrating on making it easy for users to automate tasks. Linux and open source are largely built exactly for [automation and orchestration][6], and not just for servers. Tools like [ImageMagick][7] and [GIMP scripts][8] have changed the way I work with images, both for bulk processing and idle experimentation.

You never know what you might create, given tools that you've never imagined existed.

### Linux artists

There's a whole [community of artists using open source][9], from [photography][10] to [makers][11] to [musicians][12], and much much more. If you want to get creative, give Linux a go.
