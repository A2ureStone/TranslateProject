2023 年值得期待的 11 个新发行版
======

你对 2023 年有什么期待？试试这些发行版吧！

![2023 年值得期待的 11 个新发行版][1]

是时候向 2022 年说再见了！📆

2022 年有很多发行版发布，有些比其他的更出色。

随着更加关注用户体验和性能方面的趋势，Linux 发行版在过去的一年中有了显著的发展。

对于你，最终用户，你现在有几个选择。你可以尝试一些 [对初学者友好的选项][2] 或者尝试一些 [高级用户的发行版][3]。

在本文中，我将重点介绍一些你可以尝试的新发行版。这些发行版可能不一定能取代现有的流行发行版。但是，如果你想尝试一些新的东西，可以随意浏览列表。

所以，你在 2023 年可以期待什么？🤔

好吧，为了回答这个问题，让我们踏上发行版之旅吧！

> 💡 新的发行版可能不适合生产环境。如果你不介意尝试新的东西，可以尝试这些选项。

### 1. Vanilla OS

![vanilla os][4]

Ubuntu 的发行版，是 [Bottles][5] 的创建者 Mirko Brombin 的心血结晶。

它旨在提供一个具有**干净，原生的 GNOME 体验，以及按需不变性**和优秀的首次安装体验。

> LCTT 译注：按需不变性（on-demand immutability），指一个可以按需启用的功能，用于确保系统文件不会被随意更新。

如果你想尝试一些新的东西并且想尝试一下按需不变性这个令 Vanilla OS 如此独特的功能，可以尝试一下这个发行版。

它还没有，在一段时间内也不会收到稳定版本，并且准备在 2023 年收到许多改进。

[Vanilla OS][6]

### 2. XeroLinux

![xeroxlinux][7]

Steve，也就是 TechXero，开始了 [XeroLinux][8] 作为一个兴趣项目，这个项目并不是一个主流发行版，也没有各种花里胡哨的东西。

Arch Linux 的 **'养眼' 版本** 提供了令人愉快的开箱即用体验和一些令人兴奋的功能。

如果你想要一个更加易用的 Arch Linux 体验，可以尝试这个。

**从 2023 年 1 月起**，XeroLinux 将切换到每月发布的计划。所以，你可以期待 2023 年有很多更新！

[XeroLinux][9]

### 3. Crystal Linux

![crystal linux][10]

Crystal Linux is an upcoming Arch-based distro that wants to **provide an easy-to-use desktop experience coupled with modern Linux technologies**.

In its current form, it may not be welcoming to newcomers, and people with experience using Linux are likelier to like it.

So, for now, I would suggest users who are already familiar with Linux give Crystal Linux a try.

I expect Crystal Linux to have a stable release sometime in 2023 with many features and improvements over the [beta version][11] that is available right now.

### 4. TUXEDO OS

![tuxedo os][13]

[TUXEDO OS][14] is an Ubuntu-based offering from TUXEDO Computers, a Linux-focused hardware manufacturer.

It features the KDE Plasma desktop environment with extras like **TUXEDO Control Center** to fine-tune your hardware and **TUXEDO Tomte**, a configuration service for resolving driver/missing package issues.

I suggest you try this if you want a **different KDE-powered experience**.

Initially, it was only made available as a pre-installed operating system on TUXEDO laptops and computers.

But later, it received a general use release back in September 2022 dubbed as 'TUXEDO OS 1'. It is set to receive plenty of updates in 2023.

[TUXEDO OS][15]

### 5. EuroLinux

![euro linux][16]

An RHEL-based distro with **enterprise perks** is what [EuroLinux][17] is. It provides stability and security in a solid package.

Based on **RHEL 9**, it can provide seamless compatibility with other [RHEL-based server distros][18] such as Rocky Linux, CentOS, AlmaLinux, and more.

It aims to lure in Windows and macOS users with a familiar user interface layout with its implementation of a translucent dock at the bottom of the screen.

You should try this because the overall package is quite adequate and can cater to both Linux and Windows/macOS users.

It is now available as stable release, with updates planned for 2023.

[EuroLinux Desktop][19]

### 6. Zinc

![zinc][20]

[Zinc][21] is an **Ubuntu-based distro** that has been tweaked to provide a unique experience. Existing Ubuntu users may be surprised to see what it has to offer.

Based on the latest LTS release of **Xubuntu**, it uses the XFCE desktop environment with numerous improvements, such as integrated Linux AppImage support, deb-get package installer, BTRFS as the default file system, and more.

This distro can be a viable alternative to replace your daily driver, provided it is set up correctly.

It follows a stable release model, so you can expect significant updates in 2023!

[Zinc][21]

### 7. CachyOS

![cachyos][22]

[CachyOS][23] tries to make **Arch Linux a beginner-friendly affair** that anyone can use. It is popular because of its high level of customizability and also because it has the newest software.

It aims to provide you with a fast and secure operating system that is easy to use.

This OS is for users who want to experiment and try something new.

CachyOS is a rolling-release distro, so you can expect it to receive a ton of updates in 2023.

[CachyOS][23]

### 8. risiOS

![risios][24]

In a sea of Arch and Ubuntu-based Linux distros, [risiOS][25] is a rare sight to see.

Based on Fedora Linux, the project saw its beginnings in Seattle, USA.

It uses the **GNOME desktop environment** to provide users with a highly customizable experience with a **customized ZSH version**.

If you want to try a Fedora-based distro, this can be something new for you!

risiOS gets a stable release with minor updates pushed in between. It has much more to give in 2023.

[risiOS][25]

### 9. Exodia OS

![exodia os][26]

Another Arch-based Linux distro!#$**?

Yes. 🤭 Well, it looks like this year, we have had enough of Arch-based distros, which is not necessarily bad!

Meet [Exodia OS][27], an Arch-based Linux distro that aims to be highly customizable for users in cybersecurity fields.

Its feature set includes pre-installed **tools for all cybersecurity fields, TUI Apps, ElKowars wacky widgets (EWW), zsh, and more**.

If you are a cybersecurity expert or an enthusiast, you can give this a try!

They offer three releases for different use cases. You can expect them to keep pushing essential updates and feature additions in 2023.

[Exodia OS][27]

### 10. Kumandar Linux

![kumander linux][28]

At first glance, you would think that it is Windows 7, but if you look closer, you will find that it is [Kumandar Linux][29].

It is based on **Debian 11 and uses a customized version of XFCE**.

The name stands for 'Commander' in English and pays homage to the developer's first computer, the [Commodore VIC20][30].

If you liked the Windows 7 experience but wanted the same thing on Linux. Then you can give this a try!

Currently, only the early-release candidate has been released. But you can expect a stable release in 2023, hopefully!

[Kumander][29]

### 11. Ubuntu Unity

![ubuntu unity][31]

Declared as an official flavor of Ubuntu [earlier this year][32], Ubuntu Unity is a remix of Ubuntu.

It features the **Unity desktop interface** used in Ubuntu from 2010-2017, which was dropped in favor of GNOME.

The development has been in full swing, with the young lead developer pushing updates and feature additions.

Users who want to try a different flavor of Ubuntu can give this a shot. It offers both LTS and non-LTS releases.

[Ubuntu Unity][33]

**So, wrapping up.**

Even with this comprehensive list, I may have missed out on some. 🤔

But.

Maybe a surprise release will take the headlines in 2023, or some existing distro will try something different.

Until then.
