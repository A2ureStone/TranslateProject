Nokia Targets An Amateur Linux Phone Project ‘NOTKIA’ for a Name Change
======

An open-source project that aims to make a classic Nokia like (small form factor) Linux phone has come under fire, by Nokia.

The project’s name was originally “**Notkia**“, which Nokia finds similar while potentially affecting its brand reputation, and infringement of Nokia’s rights.

While it is okay to protect your business, what is it with these companies sending infringement notices to projects that aren’t even a threat to them at its current state?

### Notkia: Developing a Pocket-Sized Linux Phone

Thanks to the notice by Nokia, we get to know about an interesting collaborative effort to develop a small Linux phone for basic use, while keeping privacy in mind.

They aim to design a PCB that fits exactly in the classic Nokia’s phone shell.

As of now, they have a decent amount of things working with the hardware that includes Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.

It is not an Android-based operating system, rather it relies on Mainline Linux Kernel.

You can learn more about the project and the specifications for the planned phone in their [official blog post][2].

The project is waiting for fundraising, and will make early prototypes to available to be purchased separately.

### Inspired by Nokia, and Noticed by Nokia

Well, the project clearly states that they have been inspired by Nokia’s classic phones and they do not try to mislead any of their contributors and potential customers.

The project’s creator shared the email by Nokia on Twitter, mentioning that Nokia should be more sensitive before sending such notices to projects that are led with community interests.

> After reading the email from [@Nokia][3] one more time, I started to feel angry. This nothing more than a staged accident. Since this is already a collaborative project and contributed by people around the world, I'm going to release the complete email to its "intended recipients". <https://t.co/ZJPTZcOLmC> [pic.twitter.com/jcUkVpWx5o][4]

**Also, they confirmed that the project will be changing its name.**

Of course, as an open-source project, it should not concern Nokia unless they start selling their prototypes/phones while using Nokia’s brand name.

But, at its current state, this is more of a passion project, and a collaborative effort by a community of open-source enthusiasts. So, it sounds a bit far-fetched to send a notice to them for infringing Nokia’s rights.

_Right?_

Of course, this is not surprising for companies, but for Nokia, it seems a bit too overly cautious and anti-competitive.

Especially, when it is safe to say that the company is not doing as good as you’d expect with their latest smartphone releases.

Interestingly, there’s also an [IT company][7] with the name “Notkia”, as spotted by a fellow Twitter user. Did they also receive a notice by Nokia? Who knows?
