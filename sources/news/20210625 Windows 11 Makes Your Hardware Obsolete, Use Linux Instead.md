Windows 11 让你的硬件过时，使用Linux代替吧！
======

Windows 11终于来了，我们对此并不完全兴奋， – 但是它给许多电脑用户带来了问题。

我基本不会讨论隐私方面或者它的设计选择。可是Windows 11要求更新的硬件，这会让你的旧电脑在某种程度上过时，没有好的理由却强迫你升级新的硬件。

Windows 11发布的其他问题是啥，它为为什么这么坏？

### 只有有资格的设备才能获得Windows 11升级

起初，Windows 11增加了一个看起来不错的最低系统需求:

  * 1GHz双核64位处理器
  * 4GB内存
  * 64GB存储空间
  * 支持 UEFI 安全启动
  * 受信任的平台模块 (TPM) 版本 2.0
  * DirectX 12兼容显卡
  * 720P分辨率显示器

你可以下载电脑健康状况检查应用[微软官方网站][2]检查你的系统是否有升级的资格。

十年内的大多数电脑能达到这些要求，但有一个问题

需要有一个TPM硬件芯片，一些电脑和笔记本可能没有。幸运的是，您可能只需要从BIOS设置(包括安全引导支持)中启用它，就可以使您的PC符合条件。这里有一个向导[PCGamer][3] to help you with that.

Technically, processors older than **Intel 8th gen and Ryzen 3000 series** are not officially supported as per Microsoft’s official documentations ([AMD][4] | [Intel][5]).

However, there are a sound number of systems that may not have the support for it. So, what do you do?

Easy, [**switch to Linux in 2021**][6] before Windows 10 no longer receives updates. This year, it makes more sense than ever for you to try Linux for your personal computer!

### Windows 11 Installation Requires Internet Connectivity

![][7]

While we do not have enough clarity about this but as per its system requirement specifications, it will require users to have an active Internet connection for Windows 11 installation.

But, with Linux, you do not need that.

That’s just one of the [benefits of using Linux over Windows][8] – you get complete control of your operating system.

### No 32-Bit Support

![][7]

Windows 10 did support 32-bit systems, but Windows 11 ends that.

This is where Linux shines.

Even though the 32-bit support is dwindling everywhere, we still have a bunch of [**Linux distributions that support 32-bit systems**][9]. Your 32-bit system may still live for a decade with Linux.

### Windows 10 Support Ends in 2025

Well, this was unexpected considering Microsoft initially planned to never have an upgrade after Windows 10 but support it for the foreseeable future.

Now, Windows 10 will be killed in 2025…

So, what do you do then? Upgrade your hardware just because it does not support Windows 11?

Unless there’s a necessity, Linux is your friend forever.

You can try several [**lightweight Linux distributions**][10] that will revive any of your computers that Microsoft considers obsolete!

### Wrapping Up

While Windows 11 plans to force users to upgrade their hardware in the next few years, Linux lets you keep your hardware for a long time along with several added benefits.

So, if you are not happy with Windows 11 release, you may want to start using Linux instead. Fret not, you can refer to our guides on our main web portal [It’s FOSS][11] to learn everything you need to get started using Linux!
